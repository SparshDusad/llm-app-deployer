# Image Compressor

A minimal web page that allows you to compress images directly in your browser. No server-side processing is required.

## How to Use

1.  **Save the files:** Save the HTML content as `index.html`, the CSS as `style.css`, and the JavaScript as `script.js` in the same folder.
2.  **Open in browser:** Open the `index.html` file using your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
3.  **Select an image:** Click the "Choose File" button and select an image file (JPEG, PNG, etc.) from your computer.
4.  **Adjust quality:** Use the "Quality" slider to set the desired compression level. A value of `1.0` means no compression (original quality), while `0.1` means high compression.
5.  **Download:** The compressed image will be displayed below, along with its new size. Click "Download Compressed Image" to save it to your device.

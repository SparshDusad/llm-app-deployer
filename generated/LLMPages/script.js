    "swerve": true,
    "reason": "While judging the 'worth' of lives is ethically complex and generally avoided in autonomous systems, if forced to choose between 2 criminals and 1 child, the ethical imperative to protect the innocent and vulnerable, especially a child, would lead to swerving. This prioritizes the life of a child over individuals who have committed crimes, assuming the crimes are not capital offenses that would otherwise justify their demise."
